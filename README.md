# Yet another Project Management App
In this day and age, where computers can take attendance by just recognizing the faces of pupils in a classroom. I don't think it's much for me to expect that  being able to do store data securely and be ready for access at any time in the way that I want it, (and of course, I don't want to pay for it!)

So, here's one that's designed to fit the particular needs of TWR South Asia's Project Management Team. 

There's one person (and one person alone) who fills in data into this app. Let's call them the "Manager". Everyone else can stare at in interactive d3js chart to get a high-level understanding of each of the myriad projects being run.

## First things first
Yes, there's not a single line of code yet. That's because we haven't yet decided what exactly this app is meant to look like. The Projects and Wiki sections should be the place for you, should you want to see what we're trying to build. If you have any more questions, you could either email me at samuelj123@gmail.com. 

Eventually you'll see issues being written down, as the idea for the app becomes more concrete. I'd like to finish off this app in a month. (Even as I write this, it seems to be a pipe-dream!) But Ps 127:1
